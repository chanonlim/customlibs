# customlibs
Custom libraries for Python and some other languages.  
This is a collections of custom libraries I built myself to help with other programs.  
You can find them all here and all of these has comments in then to help you understand how it works.  
You can use these libraries freely without any concern.

If these libraries are not working for you, feel free to contact me.  
Thank you!
