# customlibs
Custom libraries for Python and some other languages.  
This is a collections of custom libraries I built myself to help with other programs.  
You can find them all here and all of these has comments in then to help you understand how to use them.  
You can use these libraries freely without any concern.

Discord.CSS
------
Discord.CSS is in alpha version and I DO NOT COURAGE YOU TO USE THIS LIBRARY FOR BUILDING GOOD BOTS!  
You may experience some bugs while using it.  
If you do, please file an issue form as discord.css wasn't fully tested!  
And if you want to contribute, PRs are welcome! (as long as they're a bug fix/features add)  
Also do note that the documentation is not yet availible!

If these libraries are not working for you, feel free to contact me.  
Thank you!
